## HESP – High-End Simulation in Practice (Course Project)

This repository contains a series of exercises from a graduate course on high-performance computing.  
*Exercise 5* implements a simple CUDA-based Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation framework.

### Contents
- `Exercise 1` – Stream benchmark 
- `Exercise 2` – A Julia set generator
- `Exercise 3` – Molecular dynamics simulation 
- `Exercise 5` – Discrete element simulation

### Note
This is coursework code shared to demonstrate programming skills in C++/CUDA and parallel particle simulations.
